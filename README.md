1. Team Name: Solo Queue |
   Team Members: Jacob Chung

Project Outline:

2. Being on a team by myself, I thought it would only make sense to create a solitaire application. Using JavaFX, I will implement the classic card game with fully-functional UI and the singleplayer gameplay it is known for. 

3. UML diagram will be included as an image attachment on Moodle.

4. Plan & Level of Effort: Since I am the only person working on this project, I will obviously have to sink more time and effort into it than a team comprised of multiple people where the work can be split up. That being said, I plan on managing my time wisely and utilizing as much of what I have learned in class as I can to ensure that I can deliver a robust, working application. The first obstacle I want to tackle is the user interface using JavaFX, as that is what will probably take the most time to get working properly. Once I get the "skeleton" of the application in a stable state, I will get down to the smaller details of implementing the code of the game itself and polish the UI to the best of my abilities.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT: 

"How can I use my knowledge of JavaFX and GUI to make an event-driven solitaire game?‚Äù

# HOW TO RUN THIS APPLICATION:

Simply run the provided .jar file using the following launch arguments in the command prompt:
"--module-path /PATH/ --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics,javafx.swing,javafx.media,javafx.base,javafx.web"

Additional instructions on how to play the game are included in the user manual.
