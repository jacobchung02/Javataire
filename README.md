4. Plan & Level of Effort: Since I am the only person working on this project, I will obviously have to sink more time and effort into it than a team comprised of multiple people where the work can be split up. That being said, I plan on managing my time wisely and utilizing as much of what I have learned in class as I can to ensure that I can deliver a robust, working application. The first obstacle I want to tackle is the user interface using JavaFX, as that is what will probably take the most time to get working properly. Once I get the "skeleton" of the application in a stable state, I will get down to the smaller details of implementing the code of the game itself and polish the UI to the best of my abilities.
